## Recommended Learning Path

Follow this path for a structured learning experience:

1. **Basics of Web3**  
   Start with [useWeb3](https://www.useweb3.xyz/) and the [38-hour crash course](https://youtu.be/-1GB6m39-rM?si=bD5DgoS5gcKax1ZQ). These will introduce you to the fundamentals of blockchain, Ethereum, and Solidity.

2. **Learn Solidity**

   - Begin with [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) for a gamified introduction.
   - Progress to [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) for real-world examples.
   - Take the advanced [Updraft Cyfrin Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses) for professional-grade Solidity training.

3. **Explore Solana Development**

   - Use the [Solana Developer Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLilwLeBwGuK7HN8ZnXpGAD9q6i4syhnVc) playlist for a complete overview.
   - Experiment with the [Turbin3 Program](https://turbin3.com/) for in-depth Solana programming.

4. **Master Additional Tools**

   - Explore [Chainlink videos](https://www.youtube.com/@chainlink/videos) to understand oracles and DeFi.

5. **Build Projects**
   - Start small with examples like [dApp boilerplates](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold).
   - Move on to more complex apps like Solana Pay or NFT marketplaces.
